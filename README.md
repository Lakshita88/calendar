Here I have created my own calendar  using HTML,CSS,Javascript.
The calendar has a month slider, and the month heading and background colour change each month.

To add the fundamental framework to our calendar, we only utilised a small amount of HTML code.
First, in order to add styling to our project, we included the external file link to the head section.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
The div element with the id "calendar" will now be used to build the container for our calendar.
Within it, two more div tags will be generated, to which the left and right arrow icons will be added using the font-awesome classes.

This calendar project uses Jquery code, thus we must add the Jquery CDN link in our calendar project for it to function; here is the Jquery CDN link.
( you add script-src and paste this link).
That's all about this front end project.
